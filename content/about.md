Hey, I'm @Abdullahxz. I'm interested in:
- Software Engineering (GO, C++, Rust, Python, ...)
- Artifical Intelligence ([GANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network), [ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), [DL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning), ...)
- Distributed Systems
- Containers
- System Architecture

I work at Azm where I focus mainly on DevSecOps along with backend systems engineering. When I am not in the tech zone, you can probably find me on a road trip.
