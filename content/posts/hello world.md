ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Abdullah, a software engineer with a deep-seated passion for distributed systems, containers, and system architecture. My journey in technology has been driven by an insatiable curiosity and a desire to truly understand the inner workings of the systems we build and rely on. I also occasionally write code that requires actual effort, but prefer not to. When Iâ€™m not fixing totally obvious errors in my code, Iâ€™m usually exploring some of my other passions.

In my free time I read weird blogs, build side projects, watch podcasts I don't understand, and sporadically go swimming. I love reasoning about, improving, and designing systems and infrastructure.

An abridged list of things I am passionate about:

- Architecture.
- Walkable cities.
- Mathematics. (The easy parts :))
- Aerospace Enineering.
- Traveling.
- Space.
- Sports.

The way we live is shaped by the cities we live in, so itâ€™s important to get them right. Ideally, owning a car should not be a necessity to live in a city. Infact, cities should be designed for people and not cars. There are countless health and economic benefits to designing the cities this way which probably deserve a longer write-up. Maybe tomorrow.

Engineering cutriosity has become second nature to me at this point. I wasn't always a curious individual however in college something happend and I could not really tell what but since than Iâ€™ve been enthralled by how things work. And this interest extends far beyond computers for me. It's the reason that got me interested in math, engineering principles, and [the art of doing science and engineering](https://worrydream.com/refs/Hamming_1997_-_The_Art_of_Doing_Science_and_Engineering.pdf).

Outside of work and personal interests, I like to spend time with a few special people. They keep me grounded, challenge my thinking, and help me grow.

While this post is a bit more personal, most of what youâ€™ll find here will be related to computer science and the stuff I work on. Iâ€™ll probably ramble from time to time about programming languages, algorithms, best practices, system design, and also my terrible code. Iâ€™m excited to share what I learn and hopefully provide something valuable as in what not to do. I will leave you with this excerpt from Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Abelson and Sussman.
